# Deep-Learning-Raw-Code


## Set up Jupyter Notebook in the conda environment locally
### Installing Jupyter Notebook (default)
code/ conda install -c conda-forge notebook

`conda install -c conda-forge nb_conda_kernels`
### Installing Jupyter Lab
`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`

`conda install -c conda-forge nb_conda_kernels`
### Installing Jupyter Notebook extensions
I really like Jupyter Notebook extensions, which support a lot of autocompletion, additional information, and in general things that make your life easier. A good default setting is included with the following install command:

`conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions`
